    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on
        the web.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is
            structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
        <li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for
            interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the
        bones or structure of a webpage.</p>

    <h1>Why Learn HTML?</h1>
    <h3>Here are 5 common reasons to learn HTML:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Build Websites: HTML is the basic building block for creating any website. Learning HTML can help you pursue
            a career in web development.</li>
        <li>Customize Content: Allows you to edit or tweak web pages, emails, or templates to fit your needs.</li>
        <li>Understand how the web works: Helps you grasp how the internet works and how web pages are structured.</li>
        <li>Employment Opportunities: According to Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment for web
            developers will grow 16% between 2022-2032, which is much faster than the average across all occupations.
        </li>
        <li>Learn Easily: HTML is beginner-friendly, making it a great first step into the world of coding and
            technology</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Features of HTML</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easy to learn and easy to use.</li>
        <li>It is platform-independent.</li>
        <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.</li>
        <li>Hypertext can be added to the text.</li>
        <li>It is a markup language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>HTML Element and HTML Tag</h1>
    <p>HTML Element and HTML Tags are related but distinct. An HTML element is the complete structure, including the
        opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (if applicable).

        On the other hand, A tag is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that tells the browser
            what kind of content to expect.</p>

    <h1>HTML Page Structure</h1>
    <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e.
        doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>
    <img src="./IMAGES/Screenshot 2025-01-31 224919.png" alt="dfgrb">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/" target="_blank">DOCTYPE html</a>This is the
                document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/" target="_blank">html</a>-This is called the HTML
                root element. All other elements are contained within it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/" target="_blank">HEAD</a>The head tag contains the
                “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front end of
                a webpage. Typical elements inside the head include:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/" target="_blank">title :</a> Defines the title
                    displayed on the browser tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-meta-tag/" target="_blank">meta :</a>Provides information
                    like the character set or viewport settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the “.html” or “.htm”
        extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p>
    <h1>Web Browsers</h1>
    <p>Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler. Web browsers show the results of
        an HTML code.

        It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser (Google,
        Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.</p>

<h1>HTML History</h1>
<p>Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most advanced version of HTML.

    HTML was initially created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share and structure documents on the web.
    
    The first-ever version was HTML 1.0, a basic and limited version. However, the first standardized version, HTML 2.0, was published in 1995, laying the foundation for web development as we know it today</p>
